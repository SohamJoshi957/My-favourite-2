            <p>I am Soham Joshi, and I love running. When I run it feels like I can push myself to any limit. I take exersize classes every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.
                
                I also like drawing a lot. When I draw I feel like, "The proportions need to be right! Aargh! This is so messy!" Even though sometimes I get frustrated, I try to never give up and eventually, A perfect masterpeice.
                
                The one thing I have always been good at is enetrtaining my family and making them laugh. I also used to make my friends laugh by saying funny things.
